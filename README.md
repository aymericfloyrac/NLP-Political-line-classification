# NLP-Political-line-classification
This repository is a project done for the NLP course at ENSAE Paris. 

The objective of the project is to classify political lines (far-left,left, center, right or far-right) of sentences, based on a selection of political tweets from the French 2017 presidential election.

The data used is to be found [here](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi%3A10.7910%2FDVN%2F6739SP).
